    "4.The group() method returns strings of the matched text.\n",

    "5.Group 0 is the entire match, group 1 covers the first set of parentheses, and group 2 covers the second set of parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Periods and parentheses can be escaped with a backslash: \\., \\(, and \\).\n",
